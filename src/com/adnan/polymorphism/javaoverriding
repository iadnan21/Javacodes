how the overridding in the java works?
Dynamic method dispatch :- it is defined as the class to the overidden method is
resolved at the runtime rather than compile time. when the program is running java will
determine which overidden method to run.
when the overridden method is calling through the super class refrence variable, java determine which
version of the method to call based on the type of the obj at the runtime
